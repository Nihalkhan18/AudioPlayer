_**Assignment Submission: Audio Player React App**_

**Project Overview:**

Created a React application for an audio player with the following features:

-User can upload audio files (e.g., mp3).

-Stored the audio file using built-in Browser APIs.

-Implemented a playlist and now playing view.

-Users can play any file from the playlist, and playback continues to the next file upon completion.

-Implemented functionality to load the last playing audio file and continue playing from the last position upon page reload.

-Used the standard built-in HTML audio player (not a third-party player).

_**Implementation Details:**_

**Project Setup:**

-Audio Player Component (AudioPlayer.js):

-library.css(for styling)

Implemented an AudioPlayer component to display and play audio files.
Used the standard HTML audio element with controls for playback.
Dynamically set the src attribute of the audio element based on the uploaded file.

-Main App Component (App.js):

AudioPlayer components into the main app component.
Implemented state management to track the currently selected audio file.
Passed the uploaded file to the AudioPlayer component for playback.

**Next Steps:**

Enhance the application by adding functionality for managing playlists.
Implement logic to remember the last playing audio file and playback position using browser storage.
Extend the application to support additional audio formats and improve compatibility.
Consider styling and user interface enhancements to improve the user experience.

**Conclusion:**

The React-based audio player application successfully meets the requirements outlined in the assignment. By leveraging React components and browser APIs, the application provides users with the ability to upload, play, and manage audio files efficiently. Further enhancements can be made to add more advanced features and improve usability.
